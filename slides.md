# Pre-commit hooks ü™ù
Run small checks *before* you commit


* **‚ÅâÔ∏è Problem:** How can I stop myself from committing low-quality code?
* **üí°Solution:** 
  * *git hooks* allow you to run scripts that are triggered by certain actions
  * a pre-commit hook is triggered every time you run `git commit`
    * in principle you can set them up yourself by placing scripts into `.git/hooks`

::right::

* **Making it practical:**
  * The [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) is a python package that makes configuring pre-commit hooks easy!
  * All hooks are configured with a single `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
  * Few-clicks GitHub integration availble: [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/) 



* **üèóÔ∏è Setting it up:**
  1. `pip3 install pre-commit`
  2. `cd <your repo>`
  3. `touch .pre-commit-config.yaml`
  3. `pre-commit install`
  4. Profit üéâ

# Pre-commit hooks ü™ù
A config that will always be useful

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.3.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-added-large-files
    -   id: check-case-conflict
    -   id: check-merge-conflict
    -   id: detect-private-key
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace

-   repo: https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell  # the spell checker with ~0 false positives
    rev: 'v2.1.0'
    hooks:
    -   id: codespell
        # uncomment and add a codespell.txt file to catch exceptions
        # args: ["-I", "codespell.txt"]

# Make a github bot open PRs to update the `rev` field periodically
ci:
    autoupdate_schedule: monthly

# Hot code reloading

* **‚ÅâÔ∏è Problem:** 
  1. I have some code in a notebook and some code in a python file. 
  2. I update my python file. 
  3. Do I have to restart the kernel and rerun to see the changes?
* **üí°Solution:** No! Python supports a number of ways to "reload" imported code.

Add

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

to your notebook (or IPython environment).
