# Pre-commit hooks ü™ù
Run small checks *before* you commit


* **‚ÅâÔ∏è Problem:** How can I stop myself from committing low-quality code?
* **üí°Solution:**
  * *git hooks* allow you to run scripts that are triggered by certain actions
  * a pre-commit hook is triggered every time you run `git commit`
    * in principle you can set them up yourself by placing scripts into `.git/hooks`

::right::

* **üß∞ Making it practical:**
  * The [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) is a python package that makes configuring pre-commit hooks easy!
  * All hooks are configured with a single `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
  * Few-clicks GitHub integration available: [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/)



* **üèóÔ∏è Setting it up:**
  1. `pip3 install pre-commit`
  2. `cd <your repo>`
  3. `touch .pre-commit-config.yaml`
  3. `pre-commit install`
  4. Profit üéâ

# Pre-commit hooks ü™ù
A config that will always be useful

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.3.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-added-large-files
    -   id: check-case-conflict
    -   id: check-merge-conflict
    -   id: detect-private-key
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace

-   repo: https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell  # the spell checker with ~0 false positives
    rev: 'v2.1.0'
    hooks:
    -   id: codespell
        # uncomment and add a codespell.txt file to catch exceptions
        # args: ["-I", "codespell.txt"]

# Make a github bot open PRs to update the `rev` field periodically
ci:
    autoupdate_schedule: monthly

```

# Hot code reloading

* **‚ÅâÔ∏è Problem:**
  1. I have some code in a notebook and some code in a python file.
  2. I update my python file.
  3. Do I have to restart the kernel and rerun to see the changes?
* **üí°Solution:** No! Python supports a number of ways to "reload" imported code.

Add

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

to your notebook (or IPython environment).

# Cookiecutter

* **‚ÅâÔ∏è Problem:** Setting up e.g., a python package with unit testing/CI/CD, pre-commits, license, packaging information, etc., is a lot of "scaffolding" to be added.
* **üí°Solution:** Creating templates
* **üß∞ Making it practical:** [cookiecutter](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/) is a command line utility for project templates

::right::

* **Examples**:
  * [scikit-hep project template](https://github.com/scikit-hep/cookie/): All the features, all the best-practices
  * [my personal python template](https://github.com/scikit-hep/cookie/): Fewer features, easier to read (I think ;))
* **üí° Pro-tip**: [cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/) is a cookiecutter extension that allows to propagate updates to the template back to the projects that use it

# SSH Config

* **‚ÅâÔ∏è Problem:** Typing long servernames and potentially tunnelling can be tiresome
* **üí°Solution:** Create configuration in  `~/.ssh/config`. You can even add pattern matching!

```bash
# Server I want to connect to
Host tiger*
    Hostname tiger.princeton.edu
    User kl5675

# Tunnel that I might use sometimes
Host tigressgateway
    Hostname tigressgateway.princeton.edu
    User kl5675

Host *-t
    ProxyCommand ssh tigressgateway -W %h:%p
```

Now you can use `ssh tiger` or `ssh tiger-t` depending on whether to tunnel or not.

# SSH Escape Sequences

* **‚ÅâÔ∏è Problem:** I already have an SSH session. How can I quickly forward a port.
* **üí°Solution:** SSH Escape Sequences:
  * Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> <kbd>~</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> (now you should see a `ssh>` prompt)
  * Add `-L 8000:localhost:8000` <kbd>Enter</kbd> to forward port 8000
